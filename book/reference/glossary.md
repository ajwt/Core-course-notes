A list of some terms used in the PSLU course.  If you see important terms being used in the notes that you would like to see featured here, please let us know.

```{glossary}

Abiotic
    Deriving from physical/chemical processes without the involvement of life.

Autotroph
    An organism using inorganic energy sources (sunlight, energy from rocks) to convert inorganic carbon compounds (e.g., CO2) to organic compounds and energy.

Crust
    The outer, chemically distinct, layer of a planet forms from magmas ultimately derived from the planet's mantle

Equilibrium temperature
    The blackbody temperature of an object (planet) at equilibrium between incident and emitted electromagnetic radiation.

Habitable
    See **{term}`habitability`**.

Habitability
    The property of being able to host life.  Typically thought of in the context of liquid water, given the needs of life on Earth, but in principle a concept that could be generalised.  

Habitable zone
    That region around a star where climatic conditions could in principle be maintained on a rocky planet such that liquid water is stable at its surface.

Heterotroph
    An organism that runs its metabolic processes using input, e.g., reduced organic carbon, from other organisms.  Contrast with autotroph.

Hot Jupiter
    A planet of roughly Jupiter's mass (~300 Earth masses) that is highly irradiated by its host star, and consequently has a high **{term}`equilibrium temperature`**.  These planets typically have orbital periods $<$10 days.

Igneous
    A rock that formed by solidification of a magma.

Instellation
    The amount of light received by a planet from its host star.  Units of $\text{Wm}^{-2}$.

Magma
    A molten silicate liquid, possibly containing crystals and gas bubbles.

Magma ocean
    When there is an extensive and sustained body of magma at a planet's surface.  Such as is created from a giant impact, from the heat of accretion early in a planet's life, or may be sustained permanently on irradiated exoplanets.

Main sequence
    That period of a star's life during which it is fusing H in its core into heavier elements.  The main sequence lasts for different lengths of time according to stellar mass, with more massive stars fusing H faster and so having shorter lives.  For reference, the main sequence lifetime of our Sun will be approximately 10 billion years.

Mantle
    The rocky interior to a planet beneath its crust, typically comprising most of the non-**metal** mass of a rocky planet.

Metal 
    This is one of those words that means different things to different communities.  For astrophysicists, this can mean 'elements heavier than He', i.e., most of the periodic table.  For Earth and Planetary Scientists, this means a material like iron or iron alloys (Earth's core being a notable example), with good thermal and electrical conductivity. 

Metamorphosed
    A rock transformed by pressure and/or temperature into a new mineral assemblage, with possible textural modification as well, e.g., banding, shearing.

Mid-ocean ridge
    The topographic expression of two tectonic plates pulling apart

Reducing
    A substance that has a propensity to donate electrons to another material, thereby 'reducing' it.  E.g., in placing iron metal, Fe, next to water, H$_2$O, the iron metal can reduce the water by the reaction $\text{Fe} + \text{H}_2\text{O} = \text{H}_2 + \text{FeO}$.

Silicate
    A mineral whose major structural unit comprises Si-O bonds.

Subduction
    The process whereby a tectonic plate is pushed into the interior of a planet.  Only known to have happened on Earth.

Tectonic plate
    A rigid outer layer to a planet bounded by regions where it is being created (mid-ocean ridge), subducting, or slipping past another plate.  Only known to operate on Earth.

Unconformity
    A gap in time.
