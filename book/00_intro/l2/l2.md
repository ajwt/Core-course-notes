```{highlights}

**Learning objectives:**
- Understand how the rock record is our archive of Earth history.
- Recognise the basic limitations of reconstructing the past from any planet's rock record.
- Be aware of major Earth-system transitions that have occurred, recorded in the rock record, and what has contributed to these.
- Be familiar with the habitable zone concept and its application in the solar system and beyond.
- Recognise the limitations of the habitable zone concept when considering the climate history.

```

This lecture introduces you to the C2 module 'Origin of habitable environments'.  We will look at some foundational concepts for this part of the course, focussing on how planets' record their histories, and the major insights the solar system gives us about what makes a habitable planet.  

## How C2 links to the course's major questions

A major question we ask in this course is:
**Is there life elsewhere in the Universe?**

We have seen during the [introduction to the course](../l0/l0.md) that we can break this down into at least two separate questions, that get a bit closer to the research questions we might like to undertake.  With the core courses we are getting into some of the disciplinary specifics of how these questions relate to what we understand, and what we do not understand, about the physical, chemical, and biological sciences underpinning these questions.  We can therefore reduce these questions down further here, to questions rooted in the history of the Earth, its biosphere, and the solar system planets; questions relevant to what we will learn in C2:

* - How did life emerge on Earth?
  - How do we find life elsewhere?
* - How did life persist on Earth?
  - What is the history of life on Earth?
* - What made and maintained Earth's habitability?
  - How does life modify a planet?
* - Why do Venus and Mars $\neq$ Earth?
  - What can a lifeless world look like?
```

C2 will touch on these questions from an Earth Sciences perspective.  In this introduction lecture we look at three foundational concepts that will help you engage with the following lectures.  

## The Geological record

```{margin} **Time** | Geologists talk about how long _ago_ something was using units of time with an 'a' on the end of the letter(s) that give the order of magnitude (e.g., 'M' for million).  For how long something lasted, or to describe how long after one event another happened, units have 'yr' on the end.  For example:
:class: units
$$
\text{Ma} &= \text{Millions of years ago} \\
\text{Myr} &= \text{Millions of years}
$$
```
Earth's history as a habitable and inhabited planet needs to be reconstructed from its rocks.  At the present day we can investigate processes from the edge of Earth's magnetosphere to oscillations of its inner core, but without the rock record we can only speculate about how these might have operated in the past.  

How good are rocks at keeping a complete historical record of a planet's history though?  Most fundamentally we might ask if there is rock from the time period we are interested in.  Unfortunately though, The rock record is mostly gaps, deposition of sediments is not continuous and leaves periods of time with no presence in the rock record.  When these gaps are small we tend to overlook them.  When they are very large, and especially if the environment or tectonics have driven change in the meantime, we call the gap an **{term}`unconformity`**.  

These gaps in the rock record get worse the further back in time you look ({numref}`fig:rock_record`).  What's more, older rocks have frequently seen higher temperatures and more deformation: they are less well 'preserved'.  This affects the amount of information that can be obtained from them.

```

Eventually, the geological event horizon is reached, beyond which we have no information.  Some of the oldest rocks on Earth are gneisses, highly **{term}`metamorphosed`** rocks that were originally **{term}`igneous`**, i.e., magmas, dating from nearly 4 Ga.

Despite all these challenges to reconstructing geological time and Earth's past, we have a remarkably complete picture of the major transitions in Earth history.  This body of knowledge, produced by huge amounts of fieldwork, is summarised in the geological timescale ({numref}`fig:geological_timescale`).

The Geological timescale of Earth gets broken up into numerous blocks of time, which towards the present get extremely numerous!  There is no expectation that you know these fine divisions, it is probably useful to be familiar with the Eon-level names that form the largest divisions of time, which from present to past are 'Phanerozoic', 'Proterozoic', 'Archean', and 'Hadean'.

```

We will look at how we can access information on the geological past below, organised into windows of time according to the record that is available to us.  Note that these do not correspond to the formal division of time you can see in {numref}`fig:geological_timescale`.

### 0--200 Ma
Over this period of time the geological record is rich with information we can access on past climate.  For the last roughly one million years we have the ice core archive of trapped gasses and water; preserved on Antarctica's.  We also have a nearly continuous sedimentary record, preserved beautifully on the seafloor: after its formation at a **{term}`mid-ocean ridge`**, ocean **{term}`crust`** passively moves away as the plates pull apart.  Beneath more than 2 kilometers of ocean, this crust gets covered by sediments raining out of the water.  

Eventually however, ocean crust experiences **{term}`subduction`**, being thrust back into Earth's mantle.  The oldest seafloor is approximately 200 Ma ({numref}`fig:seafloor`), so our record of largely undeformed sediments (not yet even turned into rock), stops here.

### 200--540 Ma
Over this period of time animal life proliferated across the Earth.  Approximately 400 Ma, the first plants colonised the continents, opening up vast new habitats to be exploited by the animals that followed them onto land.  Now, land plants constitute a majority of Earth's biomass.  

The geological record is richly divided up over this period, as you can see from {numref}`fig:geological_timescale`.  This is made possible by the presence of well preserved fossils in rocks since 540 Ma.  The innovation that made this possible was bio-mineralisation: life's use of minerals such as calcium carbonate to make hard parts for itself.  These hard parts hugely increase the potential for a dead organism to be preserved when it enters sediments, compared with its soft organic matter.  As a result, geological time has been divided up on the basis of when fossil organisms (their hard parts generally) come and go from the record.  Ultimately, it is evolution (and extinction) that is acting as the primary geological clock over the Phanerozoic.

### 540--3800 Ma
We have now entered the vast pre-Cambrian.  This is the time before animals had started exploiting mineralisation to create hard parts, with the result that our best tracer of time passing in the rock record is, mostly, lost to us -- fossils are much more rare. 

### 3800--4400 Ma

## The co-evolution of life and planet

Here is an example of putting a margin note in, with some useful additional info


## Our neighbouring planets

We can have maths that stands apart from the text,
```{math}
:label: eq:box_eqn
\dv{n}{t} = a - k
 n.
```

Equations can be referenced in the text, for example the equation above {eq}`eq:box_eqn`.

We can also have maths that is inline with the text ($\mathrm{mol \ L^{-1}}$ or $\mathrm{M}$).
