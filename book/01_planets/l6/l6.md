In this lecture we will look at how the solids in a protoplanetary disk assemble themselves into larger objects and eventually planets.  Solids in a protoplanetary disk face major barriers, and somehow overcome them, in growing to the size of planets.   This is an active area of research and one now richly informed by exoplanet observations.  Indeed, the very first discovered exoplanet 51 Peg-b, a Jupiter-mass planet with an orbital period of several days ([Mayor & Queloz, 1995](https://doi.org/10.1038/378355a0)) challenged our view of planet formation.  Subsequent discoveries have meant ongoing revision of the physics of planet formation, which extends from processes at the micron scale as grains collide, to millions of kilometers, as giant planets gravitationally perturb their natal protoplanetary disk.  The emergence of habitable planets is dependent on processes across all of these scales.

We highlight only the major points of planet formation here, but for those with an interest in this topic much more detail (more than required for this course!) is available in some nice review articles and books.  An excellent book on this topic is [Armitage "Astrophysics of planet formation"](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108344227), providing depth on all the topics covered here and much more.  As planet formation has undergone major developments over the last 20--30 years it is also illuminating to follow some of the review articles over this period and the physics emphasised in each, for example [Lissauer, 1993](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.aa.31.090193.001021) and [Johansen, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-earth-063016-020226), the latter emphasising the **{term}`pebble accretion`** paradigm.  


## What has planet formation built, and with what?

It is important to first understand the outcomes of planet formation and the objects involved in planetary assembly: the physics we subsequently discuss undergoes important transitions according to the sizes of the objects concerned.  Table {numref}`tab:01planet_facts` lists objects by 'size category', loosely distinguished by the different physical regimes they accrete by in the disk.

It is also useful to visualise the information in Table {numref}`tab:01planet_facts`, as, in the solar system case, planets have a systematic spatial relationship: massive planets are in the outer solar system, at and beyond the orbit of Jupiter (Fig. {numerf}`fig:01mass_r`); opposite to the relationship between mass and location in the solar system, planets become less dense beyond the orbit of Jupiter (Fig. {numref}`fig:01ss_pdensity`).

```{figure} figures/ss_pdensity.png

name: fig:01ss_pdensity

The distribution of density in the solar system, note the linear y-axis in this plot.  The density distribution runs opposite to the mass distribution, providing a basic insight that large planets grow massive by gas/**{term}`ice`** accretion, not solid accretion.  Remarkably, in the case of Saturn, this balance of gas/ice/rock has resulted in it being less dense that water.
```

Together, these basic observations about solar system planets point to important aspects of planet formation: There is more mass to grow planets in the outer disk (i.e., at and beyond the orbit of Jupiter); this material is richer in **{term}`ice`s** beyond the orbit of Jupiter (i.e., water, ammonia, and methane); and if a planet grows large enough, it seems to do so be accreting nebular gas, the least dense components of all (i.e., hydrogen and helium).  

The distinctions we see in solar system planets alone raises major questions for planet formation processes and planetary habitability: why do some planets grow massive (Jupiter), while others remain small (Earth)?  Why do we have a continuum of objects in the solar system, all the way from boulders to planetesimals to planets?  Are all planetary system architectures as ordered as our solar system?  How long does it take to go from dust to a planet the size of Jupiter?


## Dust to boulders
Curiously, what might seem like it should be the easiest step in the planet formation process, is the one most fraught with difficulty.  Some of the barriers to growing the dust grains inherited from the molecular cloud (Fig. {fig:01orion}) are illustrated in Fig. {numref}`fig:01tetsi_disk`, and we look at these and potential solutions in this section.

 ### Challenges to growing solids
The most basic challenge is avoiding all the material falling into the star.  This **{term}`radial drift`** was discussed in the [previous lectures](../l5/l5.md), and is capable of moving meter-sized material inwards in less than 1000 years.  This is a problem, because protoplanetary disks are observed to have a lifetime of up to ~10 Myr.  Some mechanism must therefore be trapping material in disks and stopping it spiralling into stars; one such mechanism may be [pressure bumps](../l5/l5.md).  

Even with a mechanism to solids in the disk out of the star, there is a challenge to have them grow efficiently.   What needs to happen to migrate up the mass scale from dust to boulders and beyond is for grains to stick when they collide (Fig. {numref}`fig:01tetsi_disk`-4a).  Instead, grains frequently bounce (Fig. {numref}`fig:01tetsi_disk`-4b), or worse, fragement (Fig. {numref}`fig:01tetsi_disk`-4c, d).  Both phenomena present serious obstacles to growing meter sized objects, as in this size range fragmentation is most efficient (Fig. {numref}`fig:01fragmentation`).  This results from objects gaining fractures as they grow, but whilst they are still small lacking the self-gravity to compressionally seel these weaknesses.

Lines are shown for different types of target, but the key point is the minimum in 'strength' at around 10--100 m for all materials, and the division of the space into 'strength' and 'gravity' dominated regimes.

### Solutions(?) to growing solids
Evidently, planets form and are [extremely common](../l8/l8.md), so nature has found a way around the problems we identify from lab experiment and theory.
