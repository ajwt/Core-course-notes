In this lecture we look at the processes that take the building blocks of planets and create something new, a planet segregated into compositionally distinct layers.  This is a process with important consequences for the habitability of the surface environment, as gasses are released to the atmosphere, the crustal substrate of life is created, and metals are permanently sequestered to the planet's core. 

## What is differentiation?

`````{admonition} Differentiation
:class: note
The gravitationally driven chemical segregation of material in a planet.

Essential to differentiation is that chemical differences between **{term}`phase`s** in a body can be operated on by a gravitational field to produce large scale separation.  

Some of the key processes occurring during differentiation are illustrated in {numref}`fig:0107differentiation_chnops`, focussing on how the life-essential elements CHNOPS are affected.  From bottom right clockwise around the figure this schematic tracks progressive heating of the growing body, through **{term}`metamorphism`** ({numref}`fig:0107differentiation_chnops`-1), melting ({numref}`fig:0107differentiation_chnops`-2), metal segregation and core formation ({numref}`fig:0107differentiation_chnops`-3), and finally magma ocean solidification ({numref}`fig:0107differentiation_chnops`-4), which precipitates the beginning of [secondary differentiation](#secondary-differentiation) forming crusts and atmospheres.

An illustration of processes occurring during an object evolving from an undifferentiated asteroid/planetesimal through to a fully differentiated body.  The stages shown are: (1) planetesimal assembly, (2) planetesimal heating by **{term}`short lived radionuclide`s** decay driving metamorphic volatile processing and loss, (3) eventual planetesimal melting and growth, and (4) and **{term}`magma ocean`** crystallisation.  During this period the object is still growing as **{term}`accretion`** proceeds.  Image from [Krijt+2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10056).

## What drives differentiation?

As emphasised above, differentiation is possible because of the inhomogeneity of phases in a planet.  We can see this inhomogeneity beautifully in **{term}`chondrite`s**, the undifferentiated precursors to planets.  These contain separate metal, crystalline silicate, and amorphous phases, each with different physical properties, and critically, densities.  Of these metal is most dense, and provided it does not become oxidised during heating, will sink in a mixed silicate-metal melt.

### Why is there metal?

The presence of dense metal alloys in the building blocks of planets is key to their first major phase of differentiation, and also of course drives their subsequent magnetic fields.  But why is their sufficient metal to segregate as a discrete phase?

At Earth's surface we are used to metals rapidly oxidising.  However, at a planetary scale the amount of metals competing for oxygen far exceed the amount of oxygen present in the planet.  All the major elemental constituents of Earth's mental form oxides: $\ce{SiO2}$, $\ce{Al2O3}$, $\ce{MgO}$, and $\ce{CaO}$.  Iron has the least affinity for oxygen of all these metals, with the result that it is what is left over once all the oxygen has been used up. 

The cause for excess Fe is evident from {numref}`fig:0107origin_elements`: there is a peak in its abundance prior to the rapid decline in abundance of heavier elements.  This results from iron's nuclear stability, so that neutron addition reactions inside stars terminate at Fe, after which further neutron addition builds less stable rather than more stable nucleii.  The fate of planets to differentiate to have metal cores is therefore written in the nucelear physics of the Universe.

The major differentiation episode planets experience is driven by segregation of (dominantly) Fe-metal to form their core.  This is possible because of the nuclear stability of iron, resulting in its accumulation during nucleosynthesis and comparatively high abundance for an element of its atomic mass.  This is visible in the figure here, plotting the abundance by mass of isotopes present in solar system matter according to their atomic mass.

### What is oxygen fugacity and how is it useful?
We talked above about the fact that the iron that is present in primitive meteorites will sink and form cores _if it is not oxidised_.  This brings us to the concept of oxygen fugacity...

Oxygen fugacity is a concept that will come up frequently when planetary interiors are discussed, often in relation to how they might interact with their atmospheres.  It is just a measure of how oxidising a system is, expressed in terms of the **{term}`fugacity`** of $\ce{O_2}$ gas that the system is (or would be) in equilibrium with.  The 'fugacity' part of this is just talking about the effective partial pressure of the oxygen gas, 'effective' because intermolecular interactions might cause the partial pressure to be different compared to if those interactions did not take place.   

If we stick to thinking about oxygen fugacity in low pressure systems, then partial pressure and fugacity are roughly equal.  The oxygen fugacity of Earth's 1 bar atmosphere, with ~21% oxygen, is just 0.21 bar.

What the above means is that a system with a higher oxygen fugacity, or $\ce{f_{O_2}}$, is more oxidising than a system with a lower $\ce{f_{O_2}}$.  Conceptually, this would mean if you could put the two systems next to each other separated by a membrane that only allowed oxygen to pass across it, oxygen would flow from the oxidising to the reducing system.  The more oxidising system might have more $\ce{CO2}$ than $\ce{CO}$, more $\ce{H2O}$ than $\ce{H2}$, and more $\ce{FeO}$ than $\ce{Fe^{metal}}$.  

Often, $\ce{f_{O_2}}$ is written out not as its raw fugacity but as $\ce{\log_{10}(f_{O_2})}$, because the numbers involved are so small.  Somewhat confusingly, geologists often report how oxidising a system is by comparing the $\ce{f_{O_2}}$ to that of another system altogether.  The logic for this is that a lot of 'trivial' variation in $\ce{f_{O_2}}$ is driven by variation in temperature and pressure, which  we want to see through to how oxidising a system intrinsically is (see {numref}`fig:0107buffers`). comparing it to another system with similar pressure and temperature dependence of its $\ce{f_{O_2}}$ can be useful.  Such relative oxygen fugacities are often expressed as $\Delta \mathrm{"reference system"}$, e.g., $\Delta \mathrm{IW}$ where the reference system is the equilibria between iron metal and iron oxide, which we look at below.

```{figure} figures/buffers.png

The temperature dependence of common reference redox equilibria ('buffers') discussed in the Earth Sciences.  The y axis is $\log_{10}$ of the fugacity of oxygen in bar.  The strong temperature dependence is evident: all equilibria become more oxidising as temperature increases, and nearly all do so at the same rate - hence the ability to compare to one of these equilibria and control for 'trivial' effects of temperature.  The acronyms are based on the first letters of the phases involved in the equilibria, ordered here from most oxidising equilibria to most reducing: MH = magnetite hematite $\ce{2Fe3O4 + 1/2O2= 3Fe2O3}$; NiNiO = nickel nickel oxide, $\ce{Ni + 1/2O2 = NiO}$; FMQ = fayalite magnetite quartz, $\ce{3Fe2SiO4 + O2 = 2Fe3O4 + 3SiO2}$; WM = wustite magnetite, $\ce{3FeO 1/2O2= Fe3O4}$; IW = iron wustite, $\ce{Fe _1/2O2 = FeO}$; QIF = quartz iron fayalite $\ce{SiO2 + 2Fe + O2 = Fe2SiO4}$
```

It is useful to see how oxygen fugacity is related to chemical equilibria.  The relevant example we will explore for this lecture is the chemical equilibria between iron metal ($\ce{Fe}$) and iron oxide ($\ce{FeO}$):
```{math}
:label: eq:01fo2_2
\ce{Fe^{0} + 1/2O_2 = Fe^{2+}O}.
```
We will now rewrite this equation to show how the $\ce{f_{O_2}}$ of a planet is a measure of how much iron is left in its mantle after core formation. 

Equation {eq}`eq:01fo2_2` captures the fact that the equilibrium between these two iron-containing **{term}`phase`s** must also involve a free oxygen phase, even if it is present in vanishingly small quantities.  It is important to understand that neither the $\ce{FeO}$ nor the $\ce{Fe}$ need to be a pure **{term}`phase`s**, for example the $\ce{FeO}$ could be dissolved in a silicate liquid (a **{term}`magma`**) and the $\ce{Fe}$ metal could be part of a metal alloy (e.g., with Ni).  

To bring oxygen fugacity into this equation, we need to write out the equilibrium constant
```{math}
:label: eq:01fo2_3
K_{eq}(T,p) = \mathrm{\frac{a_{FeO}}{a_{Fe}f_{O_2}^{1/2}}},
```
where $a$ denotes activity of the corresponding component, and $f_{O_2}$ is the **{term}`fugacity`** of oxygen -- numerically equivalent to activity when we choose our units as bar and reference pressure as 1 bar.  

We can also usefully rewrite the activity terms to include things we can measure (concentrations) and things we can experimentally determine (how the concentrations map through to activity), giving
```{math}
:label: eq:01fo2_4
a_i = x_i \cdot \gamma_i,
```
where $x_i$ is the mole fraction of component $i$, and $\gamma_i$ is the rational activity coefficient, introduced to account for non-ideal behaviour of components (equivalent to the relationship between partial pressure and fugacity for gasses).  If we proceed by assuming these non ideal terms are not important (i.e., are close to unity), we obtain
```{math}
:label: eq:01fo2_5
\mathrm{
f_{O_2} = \left(\frac{x_{FeO}}{x_{Fe}K(p,T)}\right)}.
```
By further assuming that the metal is pure Fe, we obtain a simple expression where now how oxidising the system is just depends on the equilibrium constant and the FeO concentration of the silicate.  
```{math}
:label: eq:01fo2_6
\mathrm{
f_{O_2} \sim \left(\frac{x_{FeO}}{K(p,T)}\right)^2}.
```

From equation {eq}`eq:01fo2_6`, and coming back to the question of planetary differentiation, we see that more oxidising planets have more FeO in their mantles.  In this sense then Mars, with ~17% by weight FeO in its mantle is more oxidising than Earth, with 7% by weight in its mantle.

```
where $Q(t)$ is the heating rate per unit mass ($\mathrm{W\,kg^{-1}}$) and $C_p$ is the isobaric heat capacity ($\mathrm{J\,Kg^{-1}\,K^{-1}}$).


```{math}
:label: eq:01total_radheat
Q(t) = Q_0x_0\exp(-t\ln 2 / t_{1/2}),
```
where $Q_0$ is the heating rate ($\mathrm{W\,kg^{-1}}$) from a given radionuclide at $t=0$, $x_0$ is the concentration by mass (i.e., $\mathrm{kg\,kg^{-1}}$) of that radionuclide at $t=0$, and $t_{1/2}$ is the halflife of the radionuclide ($\mathrm{s}$).

## Secondary differentiation

A phase diagram for a Cu-Ni alloy -- the horizontal axis describes the composition of the phases present.  In the lower temperature region, phase $\alpha$, Cu and Ni are fully miscible and form a single phase.  In the upper high-temperature region, phase 'L', the system is a fully molten liquid.  The middle region, at intermediate temperatures and bracketed by a 'liquidus' and a 'solidus' surface, is the region where solid and liquid coexist.  In this region, the system splits into two phases of different composition to each other and to the system's bulk composition (which by necessity remains unchanged).  Physical segregation of liquid from solid then creates two compositionally new domains.  Image credit: LearnMetallurgy.

A classic way to look at the evolution of Earth's continental crust is to plot the fraction that existed (typically a mass fraction normalised to its present mass, as here) as a function of time.  Clearly there is wild disagreement about when the substrate for most life on Earth arose.  Some models even posit a _higher_ continental crustal mass in the past compared with today.
