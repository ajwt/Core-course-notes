The asteroid 16 Psyche is the focus of the [NASA Pysche](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/asteroids/16-psyche/) mission.  It is being targeted because it is metal rich, possibly being the remnant core of a once larger **{term}`planetesimal`**.  Image credit: Maxar/ASU; P. Rubin/NASA/JPL-Caltech.

## What drives differentiation?


### Why is there metal?

The major differentiation episode planets experience is driven by segregation of (dominantly) Fe-metal to form their core.  This is possible because of the nuclear stability of iron, resulting in its accumulation during nucleosynthesis and comparatively high abundance for an element of its atomic mass.  This is visible in the figure here, plotting the abundance by mass of isotopes present in solar system matter according to their atomic mass.

### What is oxygen fugacity?



## Heat and differentiation

### Heat from accretion

```{math}
:label: eq:02accretion_heat
U = -\frac{3}{5}\frac{GM^2}{R},
```
where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass the planet grows to, and $R$ is the radius is grows to.

### Heat from radionuclide decay
```{math}
:label: eq:02dndt_radio
\frac{dN}{dt} = -\lambda N(t),
```
where $N(t)$ is the number of nuclides of a given radioisotope remaining at time $t$, and $\lambda$ is the decay constant ($\text{s^-1}$).

```{math}
:label: eq:0226al
\ce{^{26}Al \rightarrow ^{26}Mg^* + (\epsilon, \beta^+) \rightarrow ^{26}Mg + \gamma}.
```
The decay sequence of $\ce{^{26}Al}$: it first decays to an excited state of $\ce{^{26}Mg}$, emitting a positron and neutrino, the excited nucleus then decays to ground state by emitting a gamma ray ($\gamma$).

A schematic of the decay sequence of $\ce{^{26}Al}$ and a map of its associated gamma ray emission throughout the galaxy.  Emission is notably concentrated towards the galactic midplane and peaks towards the galactic centre, both regions where star formation rates are higher.  Image credit: R. Diehl, MPE, Germany.
```

```{math}
:label: eq:02rad_heat
\frac{d\Delta T}{dt} = \frac{Q(t)}{C_p},
```
where $Q(t)$ is the heating rate per unit mass ($\mathrm{W\,kg^{-1}}$) and $C_p$ is the isobaric heat capacity ($\mathrm{J\,Kg^{-1}\,K^{-1}}$).


```{math}
:label: eq:02total_radheat
Q(t) = Q_0x_0\exp(-t\ln 2 / t_{1/2}),
```
where $Q_0$ is the heating rate ($\mathrm{W\,kg^{-1}}$) from a given radionuclide at $t=0$, $x_0$ is the concentration by mass (i.e., $\mathrm{kg\,kg^{-1}}$) of that radionuclide at $t=0$, and $t_{1/2}$ is the halflife of the radionuclide ($\mathrm{s}$).

## Chemistry of differentiation

We can have maths that stands apart from the text,
```{math}
:label: eq:02d_value
D_i^{1,2} = \frac{x^1_i}{x^2_i}
```


## Secondary differentiation

### Crusts

```{list-table} The major element composition of Earth's crusts compared to its mantle.  All compositions in weight percent (not renormalised to 100 for elements not given).  Compositions from [McDonough & Sun (1995)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0009-2541(94)00140-4) (mantle), [Workman & Hart (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2004.12.005) (basalt), and [Rudnick & Gao](https://www.geol.umd.edu/~rudnick/PDF/Rudnick_Gao_Treatise.pdf) (continental crust).

A classic way to look at the evolution of Earth's continental crust is to plot the fraction that existed (typically a mass fraction normalised to its present mass, as here) as a function of time.  Clearly there is wild disagreement about when the substrate for most life on Earth arose.  Some models even posit a _higher_ continental crustal mass in the past compared with today.
