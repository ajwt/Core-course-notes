It is being targeted because it is metal rich, possibly being the remnant core of a once larger **{term}`planetesimal`**.  Image credit: Maxar/ASU; P. Rubin/NASA/JPL-Caltech.

An illustration of processes occurring during an object evolving from an undifferentiated asteroid/planetesimal throught to a fully differentiated body.  The stages shown are: (1) planetesimal assembly, (2) planetesimal heating by **{term}`short lived radionuclide`s** decay driving metamorphic volatile processing and loss, (3) eventual planetesimal melting and growth, and (4) and **{term}`magma ocean`** crystallisation.  During this period the object is still growing as **{term}`accretion`** proceeds.  Image from [Krijt+2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10056).

## What drives differentiation?


### Why is there metal?

The major differentiation episode planets experience is driven by segregation of (dominantly) Fe-metal to form their core.  This is possible because of the nuclear stability of iron, resulting in its accumulation during nucleosynthesis and comparatively high abundance for an element of its atomic mass.  This is visible in the figure here, plotting the abundance by mass of isotopes present in solar system matter according to their atomic mass.

### What is oxygen fugacity and how is it useful?
Oxygen fugacity is a concept that will come up frequently when planetary interiors are discussed, and often in relation to how they might interact with their atmospheres.  It is just a measure of how oxidising a system is, expressed in terms of the **{term}`fugacity`** of $\ce{O_2}$ gas that the system is (or would be) in equilibrium with.  The 'fugacity' part of this is just talking about the effective partial pressure of the oxygen gas, 'effective' in the sense that because of intermolecular interactions the partial pressure might be different compared to if those interactions did not take place.   The oxygen fugacity of Earth's 1 bar atmosphere, with ~21% oxygen, is just 0.21 bar.

What the above means is that a system with a higher oxygen fugacity, or $\ce{f_{O_2}}$, is more oxidising than a system with a lower $\ce{f_{O_2}}$.  The more oxidising system might have more $\ce{CO2}$ than $\ce{CO}$, more $\ce{H2O}$ than $\ce{H2}$, and more $\ce{FeO}$ than $\ce{Fe^{metal}}$.  

Often, $\ce{f_{O_2}}$ is written out not as its raw fugacity but as $\ce{\log_{10}(f_{O_2})}$, because the numbers involved are so small.  Somewhat confusingly, geologists often report how oxidising a system is by comparing the $\ce{f_{O_2}}$ to that of another system altogether.  The logic for this is that a lot of 'trivial' variation in $\ce{f_{O_2}}$ is driven by variation in temperature and pressure, which if we want to see through to how oxidising a system intrinsically is, comparing it to another system with similar pressure and temperature dependence of its $\ce{f_{O_2}}$ can be useful.  Such relative oxygen fugacities are often expressed as $\Delta \mathrm{"reference system"}$, e.g., $\Delta \mathrm{IW}$ where the reference system is the equilibria between iron metal and iron oxide, which we look at below.

It is useful to see how oxygen fugacity is related to chemical equilibria.  The relevant example we will explore for this lecture is the chemical equilibria between iron metal ($\ce{Fe}$) and iron oxide ($\ce{FeO}$):
```{math}
:label: eq:01fo2_2
\ce{Fe^{0} + 1/2O_2 = Fe^{2+}O}.
```
We will now rewrite this equation to show how the $\ce{f_{O_2}}$ of a planet is a measure of how much iron is left in its mantle after core formation. 

Equation {eq}`eq:01fo2_2` captures the fact that the equilibrium between these two iron-containing **{term}`phases`** must also involve a free oxygen phase, even if it is present in vanishingly small quantities.  It is important to understand that neither the $\ce{FeO}$ nor the $\ce{Fe}$ need to be a pure **{term}`phases`**, for example the $\ce{FeO}$ could be dissolved in a silicate liquid (a **{term}`magma`**) and the $\ce{Fe}$ metal could be part of a metal alloy (e.g., with Ni).  

To bring oxygen fugacity into this equation, we need to write out the equilibrium constant
```{math}
:label: eq:01fo2_3
K_{eq}(T,p) = \mathrm{\frac{a_{FeO}}{a_{Fe}f_{O_2}^{1/2}}},
```
where $a$ denotes activity of the corresponding component, and $f_{O_2}$ is the **{term}`fugacity`** of oxygen -- numerically equivalent to activity when we choose our units as bar and reference pressure as 1 bar.  

We can also usefully rewrite the activity terms to include things we can measure (concentrations) and things we can experimentally determine (how the concentrations map through to activity), giving
```{math}
:label: eq:01fo2_4
a_i = x_i \cdot \gamma_i,
```
where $x_i$ is the mole fraction of component $i$, and $\gamma_i$ is the rational activity coefficient, introduced to account for non-ideal behaviour of components (equivalent to the relationship between partial pressure and fugacity for gasses).  If we proceed by assuming these non ideal terms are not important (i.e., are close to unity), we obtain
```{math}
:label: eq:01fo2_5
\mathrm{
f_{O_2} = \left(\frac{x_{FeO}}{x_{Fe}K(p,T)}\right)}.
```
By further assuming that the metal is pure Fe, we obtain a simple expression where now how oxidising the system is just depends on the equilibrium constant and the FeO concentration of the silicate.  
```{math}
:label: eq:01fo2_6
\mathrm{
f_{O_2} \sim \left(\frac{x_{FeO}}{K(p,T)}\right)^2}.
```

From equation {eq}`eq:01fo2_6`, and coming back to the question of planetary differentiation, we see that more oxidising planets have more FeO in their mantles.  In this sense then Mars, with ~17% by weight FeO in its mantle is more oxidising than Earth, with 7% by weight in its mantle.  

## Heat and differentiation

The temperature that accretion alone will heat bodies to as a function of their size.  Assuming no heat loss during accretion.
```

### Heat from accretion

```{math}
:label: eq:01accretion_heat
U = -\frac{3}{5}\frac{GM^2}{R},
```
where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass the planet grows to, and $R$ is the radius is grows to.

### Heat from radionuclide decay
```{math}
:label: eq:01dndt_radio
\frac{dN}{dt} = -\lambda N(t),
```
where $N(t)$ is the number of nuclides of a given radioisotope remaining at time $t$, and $\lambda$ is the decay constant ($\text{s^-1}$).

```{math}
:label: eq:0126al
\ce{^{26}Al \rightarrow ^{26}Mg^* + (\epsilon, \beta^+) \rightarrow ^{26}Mg + \gamma}.
```
The decay sequence of $\ce{^{26}Al}$: it first decays to an excited state of $\ce{^{26}Mg}$, emitting a positron and neutrino, the excited nucleus then decays to ground state by emitting a gamma ray ($\gamma$).

```

```{math}
:label: eq:01rad_heat
\frac{d\Delta T}{dt} = \frac{Q(t)}{C_p},
```
where $Q(t)$ is the heating rate per unit mass ($\mathrm{W\,kg^{-1}}$) and $C_p$ is the isobaric heat capacity ($\mathrm{J\,Kg^{-1}\,K^{-1}}$).


```{math}
:label: eq:01total_radheat
Q(t) = Q_0x_0\exp(-t\ln 2 / t_{1/2}),
```
where $Q_0$ is the heating rate ($\mathrm{W\,kg^{-1}}$) from a given radionuclide at $t=0$, $x_0$ is the concentration by mass (i.e., $\mathrm{kg\,kg^{-1}}$) of that radionuclide at $t=0$, and $t_{1/2}$ is the halflife of the radionuclide ($\mathrm{s}$).

A classic way to look at the evolution of Earth's continental crust is to plot the fraction that existed (typically a mass fraction normalised to its present mass, as here) as a function of time.  Clearly there is wild disagreement about when the substrate for most life on Earth arose.  Some models even posit a _higher_ continental crustal mass in the past compared with today.
