## How to use this Website

This website contains summary notes to accompany each lecture of the course.
These are divided into thematic blocks, corresponding to the four lecture blocks of the course.

These notes are intended to complement the lectures; they will not contain all the material you are given in lectures and are not intended as a replacement for the lectures.
It is essential to attend the course lectures and complete the practical components of the course if you want to do well.

## Course Structure

The course has four modules, which are here to give an example of a list:

- C1: The origin of planets
- C2: The origin of habitable environments
- C3: The origin and detection of life
- C4: Biospheres


### Exam (30%)

Here we discuss the figure below, serving as a useful example {numref}`fig:test_figure` of linking text to figures.

```{figure} ./figures/trappist_1.jpg
---
name: fig:test_figure
figclass: margin-caption
---
A test figure to be replaced with real course content.
```

### Computational Exam (20%)

Here is an example of putting a margin note in, with some useful additional info

```{margin} Units!
:class: units
$$
n &= \mathrm{concentration} \\
t &= \mathrm{time} \\
a &= \mathrm{concentration~time^{-1}} \\
k &= \mathrm{time^{-1}}
$$
```

### Policy Paper (25%)

We can have maths that stands apart from the text,
```{math}
:label: eq:box_eqn
\dv{n}{t} = a - k
 n.
```

Equations can be referenced in the text, for example the equation above {eq}`eq:box_eqn`.

We can also have maths that is inline with the text ($\mathrm{mol \ L^{-1}}$ or $\mathrm{M}$).

### Lab Report (25%)

We can also insert tables

```{list-table} Example of a table.

:name: coagulation_coefs
:stub-columns: 1
:widths: 28 18 18 18 18
