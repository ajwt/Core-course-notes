# Planetary Sciences and Life in the Universe

Welcome to the Planetary Sciences and Life in the Universe MPhil lectures page.  This is a one year MPhil running at the [University of Cambridge](https://cam.ac.uk), jointly between five main departments, the [Institute of Astronomy](https://ast.cam.ac.uk), [The Department of Earth Sciences](https://esc.cam.ac.uk), [The Department of Chemistry](https://ch.cam.ac.uk), [The Department of Zoology](https://zoo.cam.ac.uk), and [The Department of Physics](https://phy.cam.ac.uk).  For details on application and admission to the course, please visit [the course homepage](https://pslu.masters.cam.ac.uk).

This course provides training in the frontier research area of understanding life's origins on Earth and the search for its presence elsewhere in the galaxy.  It is highly multi-disciplinary, drawing on expertise from astrophysics, biology, chemistry, and Earth planetary and environmental sciences.  This set of lectures takes us on a journey from the origins of the universe, through the assembly of planets, onto the establishment of habitable climates and the eventual emergence of biospheres.
